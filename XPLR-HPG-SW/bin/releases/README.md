# Quick Evaluation using the pre-compiled binaries

In this folder you can find pre-compiled binaries of several **[examples](./../../examples/)**, fully configurable from the SD card.<br><br>
Select the binary according to your board and preferred example. The naming of the binaries follows the format *`<board_variant>-<example_name>.bin`* <br><br>
You can flash the selected binary to your board using the **[flashing guide](./../../docs/README_flashing_guide.md)**.<br><br>
All application specific configuration options are fetched and applied in runtime via a specific configuration json file that must exist in the SD card. There is a detailed **[guide](./../../docs/README_xplr_config_file.md)** on how to create the file and populate the required fields.<br><br>
