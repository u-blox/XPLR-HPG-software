# Thingstream - Creating a PointPerfect location thing

## Description 
A **Location thing** is a device that communicates with **PointPerfect** (and/or other services such as **CloudLocate** and **CellLocate/AssistNow**) services and has the ability to get correction data.\
Inside a **PointPerfect location thing** page you can also find all the needed **credential settings** and **MQTT** topics to setup a communication.\
We show 2 ways of creating a **PointPerfect location thing**:
- Using paid subscriptions
- Using a promo code (such as one that might be given by purchasing an evaluation kit)

## Creating a PointPerfect location thing

7. Click **Create**
8. Select a plan from the **Select a plan** list menu
9. Click **Activate**
10. Your thing is now created
11. Click on:
    - **View details** or **View Thing Credentials** if you want to see details regarding you device
    - **Skip** if you are done


#### Creating with promo code
1. Go to **Location Services -> Location Things**
2. Click **Add Location Thing** on the top right corner of the window.
3. Select **Use a code** (right most tab) under the **Add Location Thing** window
4. Click on **Redeem you thing** (or **Redeem multiple Things** if you want to activate multiple things)
5. Paste your code (or codes) and click **Next**
6. Click **Activate** to activate your thing
