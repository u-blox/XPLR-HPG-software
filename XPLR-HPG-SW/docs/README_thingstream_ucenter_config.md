# Thingstream - Getting u-center Config file

## Description 
Certificates are used when we want to manually provide the required settings for an MQTT service.\
In this case we have to get our settings from our **Location Things** list by finding the device we are interested in.
There is one required file:
* **u-center Config**

## Getting the u-center Config file
### Steps
1. Login to your account.
2. On the left navigation menu go to **Location Services** and then **Location Things**.\
   If you do not have any location things check **[this guide](./README_thingstream_create_locthing.md)** on how to create one.
3. Scroll through the list or use the search bar at the top to find your device.
4. Click on the desired device.
5. On the pop up from the right go to **Credentials**.
6. Under **Credentials** download the following file:
   - **u-center Config**
7. Use your file as required.
