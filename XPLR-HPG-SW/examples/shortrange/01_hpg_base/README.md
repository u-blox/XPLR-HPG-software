# HPG-Base (Template project)

## Description
This is a template project to get you started.<br>
The example simply initializes the XPLR-HPG kit using the corresponding [board file](./../../../components/boards/) component and prints some basic info to the debug terminal.
<br>

## Build instructions
To build the example please follow the steps described bellow:

1. Open the `XPLR-HPG-SW` folder in VS code.
2. In [CMakeLists](./../../../CMakeLists.txt) select the `hpg_base` project, making sure that all other projects are commented out:
   ```
   ...
   # shortrange examples
   set(ENV{XPLR_HPG_PROJECT} "hpg_base")
   #set(ENV{XPLR_HPG_PROJECT} "hpg_wifi_http_ztp")
   #set(ENV{XPLR_HPG_PROJECT} "hpg_wifi_mqtt_correction_certs")
   #set(ENV{XPLR_HPG_PROJECT} "hpg_wifi_mqtt_correction_ztp")
   ...
   ```
3. Open the [xplr_hpglib_cfg.h](./../../../components/hpglib/xplr_hpglib_cfg.h) file and select debug options you wish to logged in the debug UART.
   ```
   ...
   #define XPLR_HPGLIB_SERIAL_DEBUG_ENABLED    1U
   ...
   #define XPLR_BOARD_DEBUG_ACTIVE            (1U)
   ...
   ```
4. From the VS code status bar select the `COM Port` that the XPLR-HPGx has enumerated on and the corresponding MCU platform (`esp32` for **[XPLR-HPG2](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/xplr-hpg-2)** and `esp32s3` for **[XPLR-HPG1](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/xplr-hpg-1)**).
5. In case you have already compiled another project and the `sdKconfig` file is present under the `XPLR-HPG-SW` folder please delete it and run `menu config` by clicking on the "cog" symbol present in the vs code status bar.
6. Navigate to the `Board Options` section and select the board you wish to build the example for.
7. Click `Save` and then `Build, Flash and Monitor` the project to the MCU using the "flame" icon.
